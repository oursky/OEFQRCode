 # European Credit Transfer code + Watermark
 
 The code below generates an EPC QR code to initiate a SEPA credit transfer. Almost any European banking
 app can be used to scan this code and execute a money transfer.
 
 All settings are according to the [official spec](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/sites/default/files/kb/file/2018-05/EPC069-12%20v2.1%20Quick%20Response%20Code%20-%20Guidelines%20to%20Enable%20the%20Data%20Capture%20for%20the%20Initiation%20of%20a%20SCT.pdf). See also [Wikipedia EPC QR Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPC_QR_code).

 ---

 - Example: Create money transfer codes of €1 to the Belgian Red Cross.

//: - Note: In production code, you should abstract this data to a struct with some basic checks. For example - limit the size of the Remittance fields in order to not generate large QR codes (According to the spec: "Maximum QR code version 13, equivalent to module size 69 or 331 byte payload")

//: 2. Generate a basic QR code (and scan this with a European banking app).
if let tryImage = OEFQRCode.generate(
    for: belgianRedCrossEPC,
    inputCorrectionLevel: .m // medium - 15% ECC
) {
    tryImage // Click 'Quick Look' or enable 'Show Result' on the right →
}
//: 3. Make it fancy - add a **watermark** image.
let redCross = UIImage(named: "red-cross-logo.png")?.cgImage
if let tryImage = OEFQRCode.generate(
    for: belgianRedCrossEPC,
    inputCorrectionLevel: .m, // medium - 15% ECC
    watermark: redCross
) {
    tryImage // Click 'Quick Look' or enable 'Show Result' on the right →
}

//: - Experiment: Set `watermarkIsTransparent` to `false` in order to get a different style.
if let tryImage = OEFQRCode.generate(
    for: belgianRedCrossEPC,
    inputCorrectionLevel: .m, // medium - 15% ECC
    watermark: redCross, watermarkIsTransparent: false
) {
    tryImage // Click 'Quick Look' or enable 'Show Result' on the right →
}

//: - Note: While looking very cool, styled QR codes may not be recognized as a QR code by some people. Also, these kinds of codes are more difficult to recognize by readers. Use with caution!
